/***
 *  The Direction class is used to indicate in just what way a
 *  particular Cell is unstable. If a subcell has just changed
 *  on the north side, for example, then you indicate the
 *  change by issuing:
 *	<PRE>
 * 	Direction isDisruptive = new Direction();
 * 	isDisruptive.add( Direction.NORTH );
 *  </PRE>
 *  Later on, when updating, you can check whether a cell
 *  is disruptive on a particular edge by issuing:
 *  <Pre>
 *  if( someCell.isDisruptiveTo().the( Direction.NORTH ) )
 *  	//...
 *  </PRE>
 *  Two constant directions are provided: Direction.NONE and
 *  Direction.ANY. These differ from a standard direction in that
 *  they cannot be modified. A call to {@link #add} results in
 *  an <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> toss.
